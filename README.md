# Mapping_Earthquakes

Javascript project utilizing APIs to map earthquakes across the globe

## Practicing with GeoJSONs

In this project we practiced with the functionality of GeoJSONs by first mapping different functions of Leaflet, when combined with MapBox(an opensource API site with geographical data). We mapped single and multiple points, lines, linestrings, and polygons to get ourselves ready for the final project

## Final Project

In our challenge we used geololical data to track earthquakes across the globe, layer in polygons of tectonic plates, and even create a 3rd layer to the map with only major earthquakes with a magnitude over 4.5.
